\section*{Running the game}
We should be able to run your game by simply running \texttt{adventure.py}. 
Ensure all the necessary files are in the same directory:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{adventure.py}
    \item \texttt{game_entities.py}
    \item \texttt{proj1_event_logger.py}
    \item \texttt{game_data.json}
\end{itemize}

To start the game, execute the following command in the command line:
\begin{lstlisting}
python adventure.py
\end{lstlisting}

Follow the game prompts to enter commands, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Moving in a direction
    \item Picking up items
    \item Interacting with the game environment
\end{itemize}

Enjoy the game!

\section*{Game Map}
Example game map below (edit it to show your actual game map):

\begin{verbatim}
-1 12 -1 -1 -1 -1

4  -1  1  9 -1 10
-1 -1  2  -1 -1
-1 -1  3  -1 -1
-1 -1  5  6  -1
\end{verbatim}

Starting location is: 1

\section*{Lose condition(s)}
Description of how to lose the game:

List of commands:

Which parts of your code are involved in this functionality:

% Copy-paste the above if you have multiple lose conditions and describe each possible way to lose the game

\section*{Inventory}

\begin{enumerate}
\item All location IDs that involve items in the game:

\item Item data:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item For Item 1:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Item name:
    \item Item start location ID:
    \item Item target location ID:
    \end{itemize}
        \item For Item 2:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Item name:
    \item Item start location ID:
    \item Item target location ID:
    \end{itemize}
        \item For Item 3:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Item name:
    \item Item start location ID:
    \item Item target location ID:
    \end{itemize}
    % Copy-paste the above if you have more items, to list ALL items
\end{enumerate}

    \item Exact command(s) that should be used to pick up an item (choose any one item for this example), and the command(s) used to use/drop the item (can copy the list you assigned to \texttt{inventory\_demo} in the \texttt{project1\_simulation.py} file)
    \item Which parts of your code (file, class, function/method) are involved in handling the \texttt{inventory} command:
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Score}
\begin{enumerate}

    \item Briefly describe the way players can earn scores in your game. Include the first location in which they can increase their score, and the exact list of command(s) leading up to the score increase:


    \item Copy the list you assigned to \texttt{scores\_demo} in the \texttt{project1\_simulation.py} file into this section of the report:


    \item Which parts of your code (file, class, function/method) are involved in handling the \texttt{score} functionality:
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Enhancements}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Describe your enhancement \#1 here
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Brief description of what the enhancement is (if it's a puzzle, also describe what steps the player must take to solve it):
        \item Complexity level (choose from low/medium/high):
        \item Reasons you believe this is the complexity level (e.g., mention implementation details, how much code did you have to add/change from the baseline, what challenges did you face, etc.)
    \end{itemize}

    % Uncomment below section if you have more enhancements; copy-paste as needed
